# Librela & Solensia Adverse Drug Reaction & VeDDRA Data

This repository contains the code and input/output files for suspected adverse drug reactions (`sADR`) from [Bedinvetmab (Librela)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedinvetmab) and [Frunevetmab (Solensia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frunevetmab).

The data is sourced from [EudraVigilance‚Äôs Database of Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction Reports](https://www.adrreports.eu/vet/en/index.html), also known as **EVVet**. EVVet remains the most timely and comprehensive official source of adverse drug reactions for both Librela and Solensia, primarily reported by veterinarians and healthcare professionals.

The following countries are included in the data for Librela and Solensia (note: availability differs by country):
> üá¶üá© Andorra üá¶üá∫ Australia üá¶üáπ Austria üáßüá™ Belgium üáßüá∑ Brazil üáßüá¨ Bulgaria üá®üá¶ Canada üá∞üáæ Cayman Islands üá®üá± Chile üá®üá¥ Colombia üá≠üá∑ Croatia üá®üáø Czech Republic üá©üá∞ Denmark üá©üá¥ Dominican Republic üá™üá® Ecuador üá™üá™ Estonia üá´üáÆ Finland üá´üá∑ France üá©üá™ Germany üá¨üá∑ Greece üá≠üá∫ Hungary üáÆüá∏ Iceland üáÆüá™ Ireland üáÆüá± Israel üáÆüáπ Italy üáØüáµ Japan üá±üáπ Lithuania üá±üá∫ Luxembourg üá≤üáΩ Mexico üá≥üá± Netherlands üá≥üá® New Caledonia üá≥üáø New Zealand üá≥üá¥ Norway üáµüá± Poland üáµüáπ Portugal üá∏üá¨ Singapore üá∏üáÆ Slovenia üáøüá¶ South Africa üá™üá∏ Spain üá∏üá™ Sweden üá®üá≠ Switzerland üáπüá≠ Thailand üá¨üáß United Kingdom üá∫üá∏ United States

Additionally, the repository provides a `csv` version of the [Combined VeDDRA list of clinical terms for reporting suspected adverse events in animals and humans to veterinary medicinal products](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/combined-veterinary-dictionary-drug-regulatory-activities-veddra-list-clinical-terms-reporting-suspected-adverse-events-animals-and-humans-veterinary-medicinal-products_en.pdf), filtered to include only (A)nimal and (C)ommon terms.

### üç≥ How The Data Is Prepared

The provenance of the original EVVet data, including the contents of each cell, is considered sacred and treated as immutable. Our process for preparing the data includes minimal merging, sanitizing, and augmenting to facilitate analysis:

1. **VeDDRA List Processing**: We perform a one-time download of the VeDDRA `xlsx` file and convert it to a `csv`, filtering out human terms. The resulting file is stored as [`veddra.csv`](https://github.com/d8abased/librela/raw/main/data/output/veddra.csv). The conversion notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/d8abased/librela/blob/main/data/veddra.ipynb).

2. **EVVet Data Collection**: `csv` files are downloaded from the [EVVet Line Listing Tool](https://dap.ema.europa.eu/analytics/saw.dll?Dashboard&PortalPath=%2Fshared%2FEVVET3%20PW%20NEW%2FDashboards%2FPublic%20Reports%2FPWS%2FPWS%2EReports&P1=dashboard&Action=Navigate&col1=%22Product%22.%22Product%20ShortName%22&val1=%22LIBRELA%22&psa1=%22EVVET3%20PR%20NEW%22&var2=dashboard.variables%5B%27product%27%5D&cov2=%22Product%22.%22Product%20ShortName%22&val2=%22LIBRELA%22&psa2=%22EVVET3%20PR%20NEW%22) for both Librela and Solensia. The files are then organized by year in the [`data/input/evvet/`](https://github.com/d8abased/librela/tree/main/data/input/evvet) directory.

3. **Data Processing**: The [`evvet.ipynb`](https://github.com/d8abased/librela/blob/main/data/evvet.ipynb) notebook processes the EVVet data by concatenating files, rearranging columns, dropping duplicates, and generating master files with optional, custom columns for VeDDRA category analysis.
